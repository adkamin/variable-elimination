# variable-elimination

My implementation of the Variable Elimination algorithm. The algorithm can be applied on inference queries in different Bayesian networks.

Provided is an example Bayesian network stored in [earthquake.bif](https://github.com/eBay/bayesian-belief-networks/blob/master/bayesian/examples/bif/earthquake.bif).
